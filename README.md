# Coverage

## GDELT

A repository to check what New Zealand and Pacific media is represented in GDELT data.

Look at the Python notebook for results and the get_gdelt_data.py file for some quick, hacky code.

I haven't bothered to add a requirements.txt file. The only libraries that needs to be installed are requests and pandas.

Here's a blog post where I discuss this scoping exercise: [Profiling Aotearoa New Zealand / Pacific data in GDELT](https://geoffford.nz/profiling-gdelt)
